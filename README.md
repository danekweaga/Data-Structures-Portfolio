# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures developed during lab exercises, featuring both Java and C versions. These implementations demonstrate core computer science concepts and provide hands-on experience with different programming paradigms.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Java Implementation
- **LinkedLists** - Dynamic data structure with node-based storage
- **Bags** - Collection data structure that allows duplicates
- **Nodes** - Basic building blocks for linked structures
- **Stacks** - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure
- **Queues** - First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure

### C Implementation
- **LinkedLists** - Dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation
- **Stacks** - Stack operations using arrays and linked lists
- **Queues** - Queue implementation with circular arrays and linked lists
- **Node** - Basic node structure for linked data types
- **TNode** - Tree node structure for hierarchical data
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Hierarchical data structure with efficient O(log n) search and insertion operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **C**: GCC compiler or equivalent
- Basic understanding of data structures and algorithms

### Running Java Programs

#### Using BlueJ
1. Open BlueJ IDE
2. Create a new project or open existing project folder
3. Add your Java source files to the project directory
4. BlueJ will automatically compile the files
5. Right-click on any class to create objects and test methods
6. Use the object bench to interact with your data structures

#### Using Command Line
```bash
# Compile Java files
javac *.java

# Run specific program (example)
java LinkedListDemo
```

### Running C Programs
```bash
# Compile C files
gcc -o program_name source_file.c

# Run the program
./program_name
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This repository demonstrates:
- Implementation of fundamental data structures
- Memory management in both managed (Java) and manual (C) environments
- Algorithm complexity and efficiency considerations
